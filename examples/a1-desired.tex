% \caption{\label{a1-desired}This diagram shows our desired outcome, where clients see the same replies from all servers in response to a command. To obtain this, the two servers must communicate with each other to order the commands. At this stage we don't know what communication is necessary, so we simply hide the communication inside the two execution boxes stretching over both servers.}
