Merge back changes in Morten PhD/IST_V2/spacetime.sty (to support dimline and justdots etc)
(Consider if these functions should be kept in a separate package or be part of the same.)

Add support for more interval lines in one diagram. (check what can be done with the dimline)

Support timeout.

Support false detection (i.e. without crash symbol)
- use dashed lines?

Support for finer granularity of x shifting.

Fix support for fixed width messages.

Refactor the complicated function for drawing the timelines and stuff.
